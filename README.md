# Blackjack  
This is a very basic java class, emulating black-jack.  
Two values are set one for the player and one for the dealer.  
These values are compared by calling `compare()`, which will return 1 if 
the player wins, 2 if the dealer wins and 0 if both bust.  
  
Dealer wins if there is a draw.
